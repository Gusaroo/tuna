phosh (0.9.0) byzantium; urgency=medium

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * PhoshHome: Hide overview when fully folded.
    This prevents useless rendering work from happening offscreen on window
    focus or activator list changes.
  * PhoshHome: Fix jumping position when reversing an active animation
    `1.0 - self->animation.progress` assumes linear interpolation; however,
    cubic ease out is used for animating home view position, so the new
    reversed position needs to be adjusted for that in order to start from
    the same place on the screen.

  * minor: Fix typos, indendation and code style issues
  * shell-manager: Honor action modes
  * lockscreen: Set shell state.
    And allow querying the shown page
  * gnome-shell-manager: Distinguish lock and unlock screen
  * gnome-shell-manager: Pretty print grabMode mismatch
  * shell: Pretty print shell state changes
  * prompts: Update PhoshShellState
  * home: Update PhoshShellState

  * settings: Ref output stream.
    The 'default' in gvc_mixer_control_get_default_sink () made
    me believe the object would stick around but it doesn't so
    we need to hold a ref. (Closes: #510)
  * Add PhoshHksManager.
    This tracks the state of hardware kill switches (rfkill
    hardblocked devices)
  * shell: Add PhoshHksManager.
    RFKILL code heavily borowed from g-s-d
  * data: Add icons for disabled camera and mic.
    These can be dropped once we can rely on GNOME 3.38.
  * Add PhoshHksInfo.
    This can be used to display info about the different HKS devices
  * top-panel: Add camera and microphone hks info
  * ci: Drop support for Debian buster and PureOS amber-phone.
    Drop support for Debian buster/PureOS amber-phone since we can't
    sensibly support these for CI builds since the packages in buster
    are too old and amber-phone lags so we have to wait too long for
    migrations.
    amber-phone will be handled via pkg-phosh. Bullseye will switch
    to bookworm once that's open.
  * gitlab-ci: Drop CI repo remanents.
    It's not being filled since ages
  * gitlab-ci: Fetch libhandy-1 from Debian experimental.
    We'll need this until either Byzantium catches up or Bookworm opens
  * dbus: Shell: Add showOSD and add stub
  * Add PhoshOsdWindow.
    This finally adds OSD information. (Closes: #33)

  * shell: Simplify css loading
  * shell: Don't use magic constant for CSS provider priority
  * settings: Ensure types in shell.
    We use widgets at various places. Make sure we make the types known
    in a single location since otherwise there's duplication.
  * panel: Ensure types in shell.

    in a single location since otherwise there's duplication.
  * lockscreen: Ensure types in shell.
    We use widgets at various places. Make sure we make the types known
    in a single location since otherwise there's duplication.
  * shell: Move type setup to class_init.
    Doing it on the class level is enough. The shell is a singleton
    so this doesn't change anything in practice.
  * shell: Always use g_type_ensure.
    Older code used `<type>_get_type ()`
  * top-panel: Remove duplicate properties
  * top-panel: Untabify.
    It was a mixture of tabs and spaces
  * ui: Untabify all files.
    We want spaces there. The top-panel was the first offender
    but let's get the others correct too.
  * service: Always restart
    gnome-session prefers exit status 0 - even on errors. So restart in this
    case too.
  * monitor: Add getter for wl_output
  * build: Move monitor sources to tool's lib.
    This allows usage in tests and tools. This will be needed by
    the system-modal tests.
  * notification-banner: Always use primary output.
    This makes sure notification banners end up where the top bar is.
  * layersurface: Don't make props construct-only.
    This allows us to override in the derived classes constructor.
  * Add PhoshSystemModal.
    Abstract class for system-model dialogs. This allows all system modal
    dialogs to use the same base class avoiding leaking layer-surface
    details up into the class that initially builds the dialog.
  * system-modal: Add minimal tests
  * system-prompt: Use PhoshSystemModal
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Use PhoshSystemModal
  * network-auth-prompt: Use PhoshSystemModal
  * network-auth-prompt: Focus password entry.
    Similar in spirit to 0098cdfc9d791b56f580cc76ea1f8e42a31efbdb
  * system-modal: Add style class.
    This allow to remove it from 3 ui files

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * gitlab-ci: Use http URI for amber-phone repos.
    Otherwise initial apt-get update fails because of missing ca-certificates.
  * settings: Add a long-press shortcut to g-c-c display panel on "Docked" icon

  [ Elias Rudberg ]
  * Add toplevels_pending array and keep toplevel pointers

  * po: Update French translation

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * keyboard-events: Drop newlines from `g_warning()`
    g_warning newline terminates on it's own.
  * d/control: Update from debian.
    This typos and package sections
  * d/control: Update dependencies/recommends from Debian.
    We don't pull them in on amber and we want them for byzantium
    anyway.
  * gitlab-ci: Drop test-package stage.
    Since we have PureOS packaging mostly separate drop the
    last pipeline stage since that is run there. This brings
    down build times and uses fewer runners.
  * Move overrides to data.
    This makes it simpler for downstreams to track changes.
  * Move systemd service to data/
    This makes it simpler to track for downstreams.
  * lockscreen: Drop leading space in day of month (Closes: #225)
  * po: Adjust locales to string change.
    This avoids breaking all locales
  * notify-manager: Don't leak notifiation.
    A ref is taken when added to the list so no need to keep
    it around
  * settings: Make sure we rotate clockwise
    wlroots as of 0.11.0 changed rotation correction. Adapt to that,
    we don't bother what older versions do - downstream can just
    revert.
  * shell: Properly sync lock property.
    The shell's locked property did not really reflect the state of
    lockscreen-manager's "locked" property. Fix this by binding those two.
    This will also simplify things like the rotation manager since we
    don't need to pass the lockscreen-manager around anymore.
  * polkit-auth-agent: Disable verbose debugging.
    We don't want cookies, etc to end up in the logs
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Unref session too.
  * polkit-auth-agent: Toggle auth prompt with lockscreen visibility
  * wifimanager: Toggle network auth prompt with lockscreen visibility
    (Closes: #299)
  * system-prompter: Toggle system auth prompt with lockscreen visibility
  * monitor-manager: Clarify physical and logical monitors
  * monitor-manager: Use head for physical monitors in get_current_state
  * monitor-manager: Don't bother setting up modes in GetResources.
    Only the ones from CurrentState are relevant.
  * monitor-manager: Make sure to bump serial on config changes
  * monitor-manager: Notify DBus listeners about config changes
  * monitor: Add description.
    We'll use that to match up with heads
  * head: Add connector information.
    Needed to switch monitor-manager to use heads.
  * Allow to switch output configurations.
    This allows to disable heads and turn them back on which is useful for
    docked mode)
  * monitor-manager: Flip transform.
    The transform we get from the DBus protocol is flipped
    regarding Waylands view on it. This is similar to what
    was done in wlroots to preserve config changes.
  * protocols: Update wlr-output-management
    v2 supports make/model/serial.
  * head: Use v2 of wlr-output-management.
    This allows for vendor/product/serial again.
  * monitor-manager: Improve display name.
    We have the necessary info in the heads now. Code
    inspired from what's done in mutter.
  * head: Add a mode name and lookup.
    We don't bother with a hash map since e.g. removal would mean
    iteration too so just do a linear search when needed.
  * monitor-manager: Set output resolution as well (Closes: #140)
  * head: Allow to fetch supported scales.
    We only do integer scaling and use the same limits than mutter
    (max 400%).
  * monitor-manager: Allow to set scaling too
  * mode-manager: Improve external output detection.
    If there's a single output and it's not built-in it's an external
    one. (Closes: #436)
  * head: Allow for smaller logical area in portrait.
    This allows to set the scaling e.g. on the Librem 5.
  * head: Allow to easily clear all pending state.
    Instead of having this in different places add a single helper.
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Grab focus on every request.
    Otherwise the input field isn't refocused after a failed attempt.
    (Closes: #470)
  * system-prompter: Focus confirmation entry.
    Select the confirmation entry when showing a confirmation prompt.
  * system-prompter: Focus password entry.
    Refocus the password entry when the prompt is shown. Otherwise
    the focus is on the button after failed password attempt when
    using touch.
  * timestamp-label: Introduce phosh_time_diff_in_words.
    This is mostly to make things easily testable
  * timestamp-label: Unbreak relative days and months.
    Phones have a long uptime so fall back to pure date printing
    after 1y.
  * timestamp-label: Unbreak relative years.
    So far there always was fallback, drop that.
  * timestamp-label: Add more flexibility to formats.
    Some languages want to have 'almost' and 'over' past the numbers.

  * gitlab-ci: Don't use global before_script for package jobs.
    It used to work accidentally because pipeline definitions
    had been overriding before_script, which isn't the case anymore.
  * gitlab-ci: Simplify package:deb-pureos-amber job.
    Thanks to librem5-ci!14 our before_script doesn't have to
    do the apt preparations anymore.
  * gitlab-ci: Use "needs" keyword instead of "dependencies" for test+docs stage.
    This allows for better paralelism in the pipeline.

  * activity: Allow to focus.
    This fixes the toggle-overview keybinding
    Fixes 20c3a79fb888e876f30d1a590084c87cb1c16591
  * home: Hide arrow when there are no activities
    (Closes: #261)
  * Handle logind's Lock and Unlock.
    This allow 'loginctl lock|unlock <session-number>' to work.
  * phosh.service: Set session type and name.
    This way we can match the right session via phosh_find_systemd_session
    even when not using a window manager. We can drop the XDG_SESSION_TYPE
    once phoc switches to newer wlroots which takes care of it since 0.12.0.

  [ Evangelos Ribeiro Tzaras ]
  * shell-manager: Implement keygrabbing.
    Ungrabbing is only allowed for the client who originally grabbed
  * settings: get rid of explicit volume key handling.

    plugin now handles volume keys for us

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Add session-manager.
    This adds a proper object - current session.c doens't have that
    making it hard to use signals, etc.
  * Add mount-manager. This automounts new volumes
  * notify-manager: Add method to submit notifiations.
    This will allow to submit notifications from other parts of
    the shell. Use it for the DBus part too.
  * notification: Allow for a NULL timestamp.
    This just uses the current time.
  * timstamp-label: Use 'now' instead of <15s.
    It looks odd when new notifications print '<15s' right away.
  * notify-manager: Allow derived classes to use different action handlers.
    We can turn the current 'default' notfication into a
    PhoshDBusNotification to make that even more pronounced at some point.
  * Add PhoshMountNotification.
    A notification that displays information about newly mounted
    file systems.
  * mount-manager: Indicate mounts via notifiations.
    We add a single action that opens the containing folder.
  * mount-notification: Only add action if we have a handler.
    Since nautilus is not adaptive don't add an action if
    it's not available.
  * Add PhoshDBusNotification.
    This allows us to have notification just do the right thing.
  * notification: Move do_action into dbus-notifiation.
    This avoids the special case in the notification manager.
  * data/phosh: Print version with `--version` (Closes: #425)
  * run: Simplify oneshot gdb.
    Often we just want to run phosh and get a backtrace e.g.
    for G_DEBUG=fatal-criticals:
       PHOSH_AUTO_GDB=1 SKIP_GNOME_SESSION=1  _build/run
    does this.
  * gitlab-ci: Make it simple to get a backtrace.
    This can be done by passing $SMOKE_PARAMS='-c' to gitlab-ci.
  * background: Add initial support for Background XML.
    Many 'slideshows' are just a fixed single image so handle that
    as a start. This allows us to use Debian's/PureOS background
    data (as per desktop-base package)
  * network-auth-prompt: Handle "sae" for WPA3 support.
    This unbreaks authenticating to WPA3 networks which
    so for ended in "not supported".
  * shell: Only show banners for apps with show-banners on

    parts of the shell easily and moves it's handling out of
    the overcrowded settings.
  * keyboard-events: Ungrab accelerator when GAction is removed
  * overview: Move public functions past `_new`
    As per coding style
  * app-grid: Move public functions past `_new`
    As per conding style.
  * overview: Add helper to focus app search
  * settings: Ungrab keyboard events (Closes: #398)
  * home: Bind key to show overview.
    We use org.gnome.shell.keybindings `toggle-overview` and
    `toggle-application-view` to focus the application switcher
    and app search respectively.
  * d/control: Depend on phoc that doesn't crash when unbinding keyboard grabs
  * shell: Create toplevel manager early.
    So far we were lucky that no wl_display_roundtrip () would let
    us miss existing toplevels.
  * shell: Process all pending wayland events on startup.
    This is needed to get reliable monitor information.
  * shell: Pick correct built in monitor.
    Simplify the code now that we know we have all the monitor
    information (Closes: #392)
  * panel: Fix typo
  * monitor-manager: Add property for number of monitors.
    This allows to listen to a single signal when the number
    of monitors changed.
  * monitor-manager: move DBus setup into idle callback.
    This makes sure we expose the DBus interface past setting
    up all the monitor related wayland protocol listeners
  * wayland: Add G_{BEGIN,END}_DECLS
  * wayland: Provide seat capabilities.
    We don't bother to introduce a separate PhoshWlSeat object
    for that yet.
  * dbus: Add org.freedesktop.hostname1 interface.
    So we can cherry the chassis type
  * data: Add symbolic phone icons.
    From
    https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/icon-development-kit/
    as of
    0831cbb900e02aaa37bd270a25171c1751394cb8
  * Add mode-manager to handle different device modes.
    This uses logind's chassis type and informtion about
    connected hardware to dermine the device type and
    what the device acts like (e.g. a phone with monitor
    and keyboard/mouse should be handled like a desktop).
  * Add 'docked' quick setting and manager.
    Docked manager figures out if a device has enough
    hardware around to be treated as desktop/laptop.
    If so it sets the corresponding settings like
    floating windows, etc.
    The quick setting allows to override this.
  * status-bar: Add docked icon when docked.
    Show no icon when undocked
  * osk-button: Show/hide depending on a11y setting.
    This makes sure we don't show the button even though
    squeekboard would not unfold. (Closes: #363)
  * schema: Add adaptive apps filter entry.
    This will allow the shell to have a positive list of adaptive
    apps in case their desktop files aren't up to date yet.

  * po: Update Swedish translation

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * phosh.desktop: Add 'DesktopNames'
    Handle it where it's supposed to be handled.
  * shell: Drop env setup.
    The session manager is supposed to handle this.
  * d/phosh.service: Set XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP.
    Do it here until we run a display manager.
  * gitlab-ci: Use libhandy1 for alpine builds.
    This fixes the CI builds
  * po: Rename pt_PT.po to pt.po.
    This allows to fall back for other Portugese translations.
  * feedback-manager: Drop TODO.
    We use the correct icons since some time
  * keyboard-events: Move comment to signal description.
    The comment confused gtk-doc since it stared with /** and the signal has
    a clearer gtk-doc string already.
  * feedback-manager: Fix gtk-doc strings
  * home: Fix gtk-doc strings
  * home: Properly document enum values.
    This allows gtk-doc to pick it up.
  * monitor: Make declaration match definition.
    We call the object we act on self.
  * layersurface: Fix gtk-doc strings.
    Document the function parameters
  * phosh-wwan-iface: Document interface.
    This makes gtk-doc happy.
  * phosh-wwan-mm: Mention ModemManager.
    Now that we have two implementations mention MM here.
  * docs: Add some missing client protocols.
    This brings down the number of warnings significantly.
  * quick-setting: Fix class names.
    Several lacked the Phosh prefix and hence did not turn into links.
  * connectivity-info: Fix class name
  * bt-info: Fix property separator.
    It's ':' for props not '::'.
  * shell: Make definition match declaration.
    Fixes several gtk-doc warnings
  * wwaninfo: Fix class name.
    Fixes another gtk-doc warning.
  * shell: Add missing parameter docs
  * layser-surface: Document configured signal
    and fix typos related to that.
  * thumbnail: Add class doc.
    Avoids another gtk-doc warning.
  * panel: Properly document enum.
    Use gtk-doc strings to avoid warning and make them show up in
    the documentation.
  * tools: Add a tool to check for gtk-doc warnings.
    This ignores warnings from the generated DBus and wayland
    protocols for the moment but reduces the noise so we avoid
    errors in new code.
  * system-prompter: Unlink PhoshSystemPromtper.
    It's not a class, so we can't link to it.
  * session: Unlink PhoshSession.
    It's not a class, so we can't link to it. Update the doc
    string while at it.
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Unlink PolkitAgentSession.
    Polkitsdocumentation does not end up in /u/s/gtk-doc
    on Debian so the reference can't be resolved.
  * layersuface: Add missing G_{BEGIN,END}_DECLS
  * network-auth-prompt: Add missing G_{BEGIN,END}_DECLS
  * docs: Drop gi ref.
    We don't use it.
  * d/control: Add doc packages.
    Needed to get the cross references right
  * doc-check: Ignore linke to NMClient|NMConnection.
    They can' be properly linked to even with the docs installed
    due to their odd type.
  * monitor: Document PhoshMonitorConnectorType
  * notification: Document PhoshNotificationUrgency
  * notification: Document PhoshNotificationReason
  * shell-network-agent: Stub enum doc.
    Use a minimal change since this file is in contrib/.
  * gitlab-ci: Run documentation check.
    This avoids regression on the generated documentation. We
    ignore errors from generated files.
  * Rename session presence dbus interface class to  PhoshSessionPresenceDBusPresence.
    We have mixed Dbus vs DBus spelling in several interfaces but we want to
    use the later.
  * Rename sensor-proxy dbus interface class to PhoshDBusSensorProxyProxy.
    We have mixed Dbus vs DBus spelling in several interfaces but we want to
    use the later.
  * Rename rfkill dbus interface class to PhoshRfkillDBus.
    We have mixed Dbus vs DBus spelling in several interfaces but we want to
    use the later.
  * docs: Sort in keyboard-events alphabetically
  * monitor-manager: Add missing G_{BEGIN,END}_DECLS
  * monitor-manager: Use g_autoptr.
    Eases upcoming additions
  * monitor: Add missing G_{BEGIN,END}_DECLS
  * monitor: Make debugging more useful
  * shell: Don't allow to set rotation property.
    It's marked as read-only
  * monitor-manager: Add sections.
    This makes it easier to figure out where to add new
    private methods.
  * Wire up zwlr_output_management_v1.
    This does the minimum to maintain a list of heads. A
    head represents a display device that might or might
    not be part of the current compositor space.
  * monitor: Add monitor transforms.
    This allows us to not leak the wayland transforms to classes
    outside PhoshMonitor and PhoshMonitorManager.
  * phosh-head: Add pending state.
    This will allow monitor-manager to prepare pending configuration
    updates.
  * PhoshMonitorManager: Allow to apply state changes.
    This adds the methods to change and apply new
    configuration state.
  * Switch from primary monitor rotation to transform.
    Use the output transform in instead of a degree value.
    This will allow us to handle flipped configuraitons correctly.
  * shell: Use wlr-output-management instead of phosh private protocol.
    This gives us better control which output to rotate and does
    away with one more private protocol.
  * monitor-manager: Get modes from head instead of monitor
    wlr-output-management has all the modes listed while wlroots only
    gives us the current mode via xdg_output.
  * monitor-manager: Don't apply non persistent config changes.
    This makes sure we don't switch the primary display right away
    but rather on 'apply'.
  * quick-settings: Don't leak panel in error path
  * quick-settings: Keep DBus proxy around long enough
    g_dbus_proxy_call does not take a ref so we were just lucky
    that proxy was still valid in `call_dbus_cb` so far.
  * Move helpers to tools/
    There's no clear distinction between them.
  * gresources: Sort icons alphabetically
  * bt-manager: Fix typo
  * settings: Fix indentation error
  * settings: Fix misaligned function definitions
  * settings: Sort type_ensures and template bindings alphabetically
  * settings: Don't let settings_constructed grow out of bounds.
    Use separate `setup_` functions for individual widgets. This
    helps shuffling stuff around later on and we can drop
    create_vol_channel_bar.
  * dbus: Add (not yet merged) UPower Torch interface
  * Add initial torch support.
    Add a simple torch quick setting.
  * shell: Fix typo
  * shell: Update primary monitor when it goes away (Closes: #382)
  * lockscreen-manager: Drop PhoshLockscreenManagerPrivate.
    It's a finaly type so no need for priv (and it's very unlikely
    we'll ever derive here)
  * lockscreen-manager: Fix up indentation.
    Since we created enough churn in the previous commit let's
    fix the indentation too.
  * tests: Drop unused test.
    It's neither built nor run
  * tests: Don't include bad-props.h when unused
  * tests: Rework tests using g_test_expect_message.
    This no longer works with structured logging so use
    g_test_trap_assert_stderr() as recomended by glib docs.
  * Use structured logging.
    This will pick a suitable log writer automatically and
    pass on structed information when e.g. logging to the journal.
  * Add a custom log handler.
    This is to a large extend what glib does but we don't read the levels
    from the environment but allow to set them when setting the handler.
    Resetting the handler instead of just adjusting the domains has the
    advantage that we can pass in new user_data. Otherwise we'd have to keep
    the current log domains around and protect them by an additional mutex
    to not corrupt the log domains of handlers running in other threads.
    When setting the handler glib handles that for us since handler
    replacement is already mutex protected.
  * main: Toggle debug messages on SIGUSR1.
    We need to use a custom log handler to stay clear
    of modifying the env var.
  * d/gbp.conf: Automatically bump meson.build version.
    No more manual editing.

  * gitlab-ci: Add i386 cross build.
    This ensures we don't break 32bit again. We allow failure

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * wifimanager: Make variable name match property.  Otherwise it's confusing
    what it refers too.
  * wifimanager: Compare to the old state rather than the probed state.  Emit
    property changes when the old and new state differ not when our state
    differs from detected devices.
  * shell: Attach to primary monitors configured signal.  This allows us to
    emit the 'rotated' signal when it really happened.
  * rotateinfo: Mark orientations as translatable
  * rotateinfo: Take display geometry into account.
    We assumed portrait from the very beginning but that's not correct
    on laptops and TVs. (Closes: #326)
  * shell: Undo rotation on startup.
    This makes sure we get an unrotated shell in any case
    (e.g. if phosh crashes in landscape mode) (Closes: #265)
  * monitor: Fix several gtk-doc strings.
    This fixes some of the warnings during doc generation
  * background: Load image async.
    This avoids blocking on I/O.
  * background: Avoid updating the background twice.
    Only update the settings on layer-surface configure but wait for the
    monitor::configured signal before drawing anything.
    This avoids drawing the background twice on each rotation causing even
    more flicker.
  * background-manager: Tell background about it's scale
    gtk_widget_get_scale_factor gives us the wrong value with multiple
    outputs of different scale.
  * background: Skip any image loading if layer surface isn't configured.
    There's no point to waste resources and we don't have valid dimensios
    and it breaks the tests.
  * wifiinfo: Sync initial state.
    The downside of not using a property binding is that we need to
    do that on our own.
  * monitor-manager: Set logical position.
    This makes the monitor layout in g-c-c match what the compositor thinks
    it is so monitors are displayed next to each other rather than over
    each other.
  * build: Move all dependency() calls to top level build file
  * Bluetooth quick setting and status indicator
  * background: Avoid warning on NULL pixbuf.
  * wwan-mm: Connect to modem async
  * wwaninfo: Use operator name as detail.
    This gives us the operator name in quick settings

  * media-player: Don't act on every name change.
    We were looking at all vanished DBus names instead of only players. This
    lead to a slight flicker of the widget e.g. on audio events or
    notifications (which was especially noticeable on the lock screen).
  * PhoshLayerSurface: Add missing sentinel
  * Add small testlib allowing for wayland based tests using phosh-wayland
    and spawning a phoc instance. Add two initial tests using that.
  * monitor: Properly invaliate wl_output_done.
    On `wl_output` configuration changes invalidate the done flag
    so another `configured` signal is emitted once all changes
    are processed. So far we only handled the initial configure.
  * phosh-wayland: Clarify ownership of phosh_wayland_get_wl_outputs
  * shell: Do nothing when primary monitor does not change
  * shell: Don't clear faders when we dispose the panels
  * status-icon: Drop show-always (Closes: #312)
  * Add WWAN quicksetting
  * gitlab-ci: be more robust when using xvfb
  * background-manager: Avoid recreating backgrounds too often
    Only do so initially and let PhoshBackground adjust to configuration
    changes notified by PhoshBackground intead.
  * background: Skip image loading when using colored mode.
    There's no need to even try to load an image if we're not using
    it later on.
  * tests: Add a simple background test.
  * d/rules: Depend on phoc >= 0.4.0.
    While we can run with older versions this makes sure people
    pull in a recent enough version for all the feaures.

  * monitor: add "power-mode" property.
    In order to be able to notify other objects when the power state of a
    monitor changes, this commit adds a `power-mode` property to the monitor
    class.
  * shell: lock screen when builtin monitor is powered off
  * src: fix typos
  * phosh.service: don't hardcode user name.
    In order to allow the user to change the default username, use the UID
    instead of the username.
  * po: fix French translation.
    This patch fixes the long date format on the lockscreen.

  [ Mohammed Sadiq ]
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Use symbolic icon

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * settings: Drop PhoshSettingsPrivate.
    We'll never derive from that widget so drop the indirections.
  * settings: Ensure types during class_init.
    No need to do so during each instance creation.
  * panel: Drop unused height getter
  * shell: Move settings into top bar widget.
    This will allow us to drop the xdg popup code.
    (Closes: #155, #216)
  * shell: Drop xdg popup handling.
    We don't use it atm and if we need popups again we want to wrap
    them in proper objects.
  * panel: Set keyboard interactivity.
    This allows us for keyboard navigation in the settings menu
  * panel: Disallow focus on panel widgets.
    We only want to keyboard navigate settings
  * settings: Fix QuickSetting keyboard focus behaviour.
    We set each QuickSetting to not-focusable since we otherwise
    have to press TAB twice on each button: once for the flowbox
    focus and one for the button focus.
    To trigger the QuickSetting we wire up the FlowBox's `child-activated`
    signal.
  * panel: Close settings menu on ESC and when clicking/touching into empty
    area.
  * smoketest: Keep phoc around.
    Phoc changed to exit after the session exited but the smoke tests rely on
    a running compositor so keep it around to parse some parameters.
  * po: Last time sync from zanata.
    We're switching to GNOME infra.
  * README: Point to GNOMEs translation system
  * panel: Drop superfluous gettext define.
    We have gi18n.h for that.
  * monitor: Allow to set power save mode.
    This allows to set a monitors power save mode:
    OFF: monitor is turned off
    ON: monitor is turned on
    We don't use the constants from the wayland protocol
    to not leak the implementation.
  * Process enums for monitor.h too.
    They will be used in the following commit
  * shell: Add method to turn on power saving.
    This method can be used to turn power saving on or off.
    Currently it only turn on power saving for the display but
    this can be extended in the future.
  * monitor: Use PhoshMonitorPowerSaveMode enum.
    This makes sure we treat the wayland protocol enum as internal
    to the monitor implementation.
  * monitor-manager: Remove unused PowerSaveMode
  * panel: Add a GtkStack to switch top bar.
    The top bar has a different content when the settings menu is
    unfolded. Add a stack for that.
  * panel: Move shutdown to power popover
  * Move power off from settings menu to top bar
  * Move lock screen button to power popover
  * session: Add logout.
    Since we don't have a logout dialog yet we don't ask gnome-session
    to show one either.
  * panel: Wire up logout (Closes: #234)
  * settings: Drop button to launch settings.
    This frees up space for the notification area.
  * panel: Keep settings widget around.
    This avoids e.g. a jumpy volume slider when unfolding the
    settings menu. We manage it outside the stack for later gesture support.
  * wifimanager: Avoid excessive g_strdup() on signal strength changes.
    Suggested by Zander Brown.
  * wwaninfo: Avoid excessive g_strdup() on signal strength changes
  * status-icon: Don't leak icon name
    phosh_status_icon_get_icon_name() returns a copy so we need to
    free it and also can't compare by address.
  * tests: Test phosh_status_icon_set_icon_name()
  * gitlab-ci: Barf on files with translations but not in POTFILES.in
  * po: Add files not needing translations to POTFILES.skip
  * po: Sort POTFILES.in alphabetically
  * po: Add missing source file (Closes: #305)
  * po: Update pot file
  * gitlab-ci: Allow to skip build and test.
    Sometimes we just want a package (e.g. when only changing the packaging or
    when we're sure(tm) we didn't break anything). Hence allo to skip the
    build and test stages via `PKG_ONLY = 1`
  * data: Rename compositor config to phoc.ini.
  * data: phoc.ini: Don't fall back to rootston.
    This gives confusing error messages when e.g. phoc is not installed.
  * data: phoc.ini: Honor WLR_BACKENDS.
  * settings: Hide notification box when empty
  * notification-tray: Move style closer to designs.
    Use a gray background for the tray and no drop shadows for individual
    bubbles.
  * settings: Close settings after acting on the last notification
  * feedback-manager: Add helper to trigger async feedback.
    We don't pass the manager itself since it's not needed.
  * home: Emit feedback event on home bar press
  * overview: Trigger feedback on window close
  * panel: Trigger feedback when top bar is clicked.
    This can go away once we have gestures in place.
  * app-grid: Provide haptic feedback on app launch
  * shell: Avoid signal emission when shell is already locked.
    LockscreenManager got this right but the shell would emit a signal on
    every invcation although the state would not change.
  * MonitorManager: Use wlr-power-manager to set handle GNOMEs power_save_mode
    requests. This allows the screen to blank when g-s-d thinks so.
  * shell: powersave: Just lock the screen.
    With the monitor-manager's PowerSaveMode wired up it's enough to lock
    the screen to make g-s-d then tell us to blank the screen.
    This makes sure compositor, shell and g-s-d have the same idea about
    the screen state.

  [ Efstathios Iosifidis ]
  * Update Greek translation

  [ Rafael Fontenelle ]
  * phosh.doap: fix URL to source code repository
  * Update Brazilian Portuguese translation

  [ Danial Behzadi ]
  * Add Persian Translation
  * Add Persian to Linguas

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * utils: phosh_clear_handler, g_clear_handler for older GLib.
    This can go away once we dep on 2.62
  * notification-frame: fix a leak when header tapped
    get_item returns a reference which we weren't dropping causing some
    notifications to live forever
  * notification: store the urgency/transient/resident/category hints
    urgency/transient/resident modify the behaviour of the message tray
    category is included for completeness, we may never use it
    (sound hints are still ignored as we don't declare support for it)
  * notifications: a model for notifications from a single source
  * notifications: keep a list of notifications
  * tests: test the new notification models
  * notifications: maintain a message list
    expired notifications are no longer automatically dismissed
  * notifications: add list to settings drop-down
  * tools: explain notify-[blocks/server-standalone] use

  [ Yuri Chornoivan ]
  * Update Ukrainian translation

phosh (0.2.2) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * wwan: use interface prefix.  This shortens the function names
  * WWan: Connect to ModemManager async.
    The rest is all propert access which is async.
    (Closes: #289)
  * wwan: Free GDBusObjects too. We only freed the list itself so far.
  * lockscreen: Drop unused variables
  * settings-menu: Drop expand from feedback button.
    This makes sure we don't use up extra space when other elements get
    hidden (like the music player)
  * shell: Avoid gtk_widget_show_all.
    This is needed in preparation for #155 anyway.
  * lockscreen: Fix unlock page type.
    It's a grid not a box
  * network-auth-prompt: Inform user about unknown auth types.
    This avoids another empty dialog similar to #292.

  [ Arnaud Ferraris ]
  * wifimanager: create network-auth-prompt only for WiFi connections.
    While the network-auth-prompt only supports only WiFi connections, it
    would still show (empty) if NM sends a secrets request for WWAN.
    This patch makes sure the prompt isn't created if the connection type
    isn't WiFi. (Closes: #292)

phosh (0.2.1) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * feedbackinfo: Use 'On' for the 'full' feedback theme.
    See: #276
  * wwaninfo: Don't overwrite sim missing status.
    This allows the sim-missing status to be displayed. (Closes: #281)
  * monitor: Wire up zwlr_output_power_management.
  * protocol: Generate protocol with private code.
    That's sufficient since we don't want to export anything
  * po: Update translations from zanata
    Thanks to all the translators!
  * Settings: wire up feedback setting long press.
    This opens the notifications panel now that we can configure
    feedback there.
  * Shell: Don't access variable before type check
  * Feedbackinfo: Toggle to silent instead of quiet.
    Also turn of vibra with the quick setting. Vibra can be turned on via
    g-c-c.
  * gitlab-ci: Run xvfb-run with no-reset.
    This avoids spurious test failures.

  [ Rasmus Thomsen ]
  * gitlab-ci: pull in feedbackd on Alpine too
    fixes #278

  [ Julian Sparber ]
  * Wifimangager: set icon-name always via the same function.

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * protocols: generate with public-code not code
    public-code does the same thing but without logging warnings
  * app-list: fix lookup cache.
    We never invalidated the cache leaving us in an invalid state after
    install/remove
    This potentially explains the missing icons that turn up after reboot
    (probably) fix https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/phosh/issues/213
  * apps: use a common placeholder icon (Closes: #197)

  [ Darren R ]
  * README: Explain how to skip gnome-session setup.
    This avoids spawning unintended services.

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * panel: Clean up unused widget references

phosh (0.1.8) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Julian Sparber ]
  * Lockscreen: Replace submit btn with unlock btn
  * Fader: fade completely to black on shutdown.
    Closes: #257
  * Fix brightness slider being jumpy while sliding.
    Closes: #258
  * StatusIcon: Introduce base class for status icons
    and use for top panel icons.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * phosh-system-prompt: Toggle ok button sensitivity.
    Pressing <return> so far caused to send e.g. an empty pin to a smart card
    and we'd rather not run out of retries so require a non empty password.
  * build: Bump version to 0.1.8
  * build: Use libhandy 0.x branch if used as a subproject.
    Closes: #264

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * build: bump glib dep.
    We where using stuff from 2.54 already and buster ships 2.58
  * notifications: seperate the data and widget.
    Move notification information into a seperate class from the banner,
    moving forward this will ease lockscreen/notification drawer
    implementatinon

phosh (0.1.7) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Darren R ]
  * Update meson.build to show version 0.1.6

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * phosh.in: Use builtin session handling.
    Until we can rely on a newer gnome-session use the builtin session
    handling everywhere for now instead of systemd. (Closes: #181)
  * gitlab-ci: Build an arm64 deb
  * wifi-manager: Rework connection handling.
    So far we gave up early when the currently active connection did not
    have any devices. It seems this can happen early up in the connection
    process of *new* connections. Hence always redo the device check on
    connection state changes.
  * wifimanager: Consolidate device cleanup.
  * wifimanager: Clean up device state when (de)activating a connection.
    Don't use the device and access point information before we're
    actually associted. Otherwise we show strength information from
    outdated access points. (Closes: #202)
  * lockscreen-manager: Undo rotation when locking the screen.
    This makes sure we don't leave the user with a screen that can't be
    unlocked. (Closes: #73)
  * auth: Drop pin length limitation.  (Closes: #233, #234)
  * network-auth-prompt: Allow to toggle password visibility.
    This makes entering wifi passwords a bit simpler. Inspired by
    GTK4's GtkPasswordEntry.

  [ Julian Sparber ]
  * Lockscreen: add submit button, allows arbitrary pin lengths.
    This also adds the emergency button but for now it is hidden, because
    emergency calls don't work yet.

phosh (0.1.6) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Julian Sparber ]
  * Lockscreen: replace HdyDialer with HdyKeypad.
    The new Keypad uses a GtkEntry to store the entered pin/password.
  * Lockscreen: use GcrSecureEntryBuffer for the pin entry.
  * BatteryInfo: drop private data for gobject.
    Since the BatteryInfo is a final it can't be subclassed, therefore it
    doesn't need private data.

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * background: Plug leak
  * home: Plug leak
  * topevel: Avoid NULL check
  * toplevel: Don't leak app_id and title
  * toplevel: Guard handle from being destroyed multiple times
  * wwaninfo: Seperate access tec and signal srength (Closes: #118)
  * top-panel: Adjust label margins.
    Use the same margins as for other text in the top panel.
  * top-panel: Use only right margins.

  [ Darren R ]
  * lockscreen: Use show_symbols False

phosh (0.1.5) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * rootston.ini: Drop keyboard config section.
    Not parsed anymore by phoc, uses GSettings now
  * Turn on autorestart.
    Mitigates #212
  * gitlab-ci: Switch to shared gitlab-ci jobs.
    This gives us more tests with less code.
  * debian: Add trivial autopkgtest.
    This makes sure we at least install correctly
  * wifimanager: Don't leak icon name
  * d/control: Depend on the used gsettings schema
  * gitlab-ci: Test pureos against staging.
  * build: Make libhandy dep explicit
  * wwan-mm: Give up if we can't get proxy.
    Just printing a warning is no enough.
  * wwaninfo: Only show wwan icon if a modem is present
    (Closes: #64)

  [ Julian Sparber ]
  * Bump libhandy to 0.0.12

phosh (0.1.4) amber; urgency=medium

  * activity: Add title setter
  * activity: Set app_name on title changes.
    So far we only did this in the constructor.
  * toplevel: Emit signal when properties change.
    So far we emitted signals when a new toplevel shows up. Add
    a signal that is emitted when a already 'configured' toplevel
    gets configured event. This will allow to e.g. check for
    title changes.
  * overview: Adjust title in overview when the toplevel changes title.
    We take a detour via the overview since the link between
    activity and topleve happens there. We can avoid this
    once the activity properly owns the toplevel.
  * tests: Avoid duplicate config target
    otherwise we fail with meson 0.49.
  * gitlab-ci: Build pureos amber package as well
  * panel: Move decision if we need a lang label into one place.
    This makes sure we do the same on input source changes and keyboard
    connect/disconnect.
  * debian/gbp.conf: Sign tags by default

phosh (0.1.3) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * main: Simplify signal handling
  * main: Handle SIGINT as well.
  * main: Don't initially lock screen when we were started by gdm
  * main: Add -L to force a locked shell.
  * brightness: Fix brightness setting.
  * top-panel: Display current keyboard layout if a keyboard is connected.
    This makes tings less conusing when using/testing different layouts
    The layout is only displayed when a keyboard is connected to the
    seat.
  * session: Unset DESKTOP_AUTOSTART_ID.
    This makes sure we don't leak it to child processes.

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * activity: Handle apps with "gnome-" prefix in their app ID.
    Otherwise we end up with "org.gnome.Gnome-software" kind of names.
  * util: Move app_id fix up code to separate function
  * toplevel: Rename phosh_toplevel_raise to _activate for consistency
  * app-grid-button: Activate existing window instead of trying to relaunch.
    Fixes #102

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * build: only rebuild generated sources when linking tests/tools.
    This avoids extra (wasted) build steps for tools/tests/etc
  * app-button: don't emit app-launched when an error is set.
    Previously we emited even when GLib reports an error
  * app-button: store favourites in a model, add action menu.
  * tests: improve testing of app-button.
  * tests: add tests for the favourites model.
  * favourites: use en_US spelling.

phosh (0.1.2) amber; urgency=medium

  [ Bart Ribbers ]
  * gitlab-ci: don't build test coverage for Alpine Linux

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Add wayland session file.
    This allows to run phosh directly from e.g. gdm which makes testing
    on GNOME way easier
  * Recommend phoc. We don't make it a hard dependency since we can run with
    other compositors as well.
  * Drop all rootston fallbacks. rootston is unmaintained and has only very
    limited functionality while phoc had a release.
  * debian: Bump compat to 12.
    This makes some things simpler like dh_nissing and it moves
    phosh to /u/libexec where it should have always been.
  * debian: Add install file for phosh.
    This makes us pick up the right files when we add more binary packages
  * build: move glib/gio dependency to toplevel meson file.
    This and assigining it to variables makes it simpler for
    other meson files to use.
  * Add keyboard stub.
    This helps to fulfil gnome-session dependencies on desktops where we
    don't have squeekboard (yet) and where it should not unfold
  * layer-surface: Emit signals on width/height changes.
    We missed signals on phosh_layer_surface_set_size().
  * layer-surface: Don't make width/height construct only.
  * po: Update translatable files
  * po: Update translations from zanata

  [ Dorota Czaplejewicz ]
  * layersurface: remove phosh-wayland include.
    This makes the file copy-portable again.
  * layer-surface: Distinguish requested and configured width/height
    {width,height} represent the user request while
    configured_{width,height} represent what the compositor sent us.
    This allows clients to see how their size request matches the
    actual surface size.

    It was unused anyway. (Closes: #195)
  * notify-manager: ignore errors closing inexistent notifications.
    This trips up qt 5.11 otherwise
  * debian: Don't restart session on package upgrades.
    Otherwise a logged in user will get logged out. (Closes: #193)

phosh (0.1.0) amber-phone; urgency=medium

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * app-grid: align top
  * overview: focus styling, follow focus
  * app-grid: enter activates first app search result.
    Fix https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/phosh/issues/171
  * app-grid: hint app that will launch on enter
  * notifications: support images, bring styles close to design
  * notifications: add actions.
    This means firefox doesn't complain anymore and actions are clickable
  * notifications: handle display scaling and rotation
  * notifications: slide down from top
  * tools: test notification sender
  * notifications: emit notify::app-info
  * apps: display name not display name.
    This makes sure apps have the same name as in shell

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * overview: Remove close on click.
    It's triggered wher swiping PhoshPaginator. I'm not sure this is wanted
    from design standpoint anyway, so remove it for now.

  * notify-manager: Handle org.gnome.desktop.notifications show-banners.
    This allows to globally enable / disable message bunners aka
    'notification popups' as gnome-control-center calls them. (Closes: #167)
  * build: sort source alphabetically
  * session: Reindent.
    Reindent according to coding style
  * Add fader that fades from transparent to almost black.
    We might want to make this more flexible later so we can also use
    it for the fade in animation on startup.
  * session: Use fader on shutdown.
    This gives immediate visual feedback.
  * main: Fade out on sigterm
  * po: Update translatable files
  * session: Only show fader on EndSession.
    QueryEndSession only asks for a shutdown, we don't want to fade
    in that case.
  * Kill fader after 15 seconds
    if we can't shut down promptly kill the fader instead of leaving
    the shell in an unusable state.
  * auth: Unconditionally set pamh to NULL.
    Don't do it only in the successful case since the handle is
    not useful afterwards and later calls might otherwise reuse the handle.
    Also don't use the handle in the error path after pam_end.
  * rootston.ini: Remove 'binding' section.
    This is now handled via gsettings and triggers a warning
    on phoc startup.
  * po: Update translatable files
  * po: Update translations from zanata

  * AppGrid: Make line below favorites darker and thiner
    fixes #182
  * AppGrid: use a revealer to hide the favorites when search is started
    fixes: #185
  * AppGrid: increase spacing around line below favorites

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * PhoshBackgroundManager: Divide the background size by scale.
    Without this the background surface buffer is needlessly oversized,
    putting unnecesary load on the GPU.
  * toplevel: Add "activated" property and its getter
  * overview: Scroll to currently focused activity
  * style: Remove unnecessary blending.
    GTK uses software rendering and pixman isn't optimized on aarch64.
    This makes blending huge surfaces pretty expensive - and there's
    no reason to do that if we're blending black on black anyway.
    This makes fullscreen scrolling in app drawer way smoother.

  [ Hysterical Raisins ]
  * AppGrid: hide favorites on search
    - conserve vertical screen space (which will be at a premium when both osk
      and overview are visible at the same time)
    - blend in favorites when searching
    Fixes phosh#177
  * NotifyManager: plug a leak in variant iteration
  * AppGrid: Don't activate first item unless search has focus.
    Fixes #177 (for real this time)
  * AppGrid: Correct return types for focus events
  * AppGrid: plug casefold leaks.
    Fixes #190

  [ Tobias Bernard ]
  * Style: prettier search bar
    - Minor styling changes (rounded corners, more padding)
    - Add placeholder text
  * Style: adjust margins around search bar and favorites.
    Fixes an issue with icons being cut-off only on the sides
    when scrolling.
  * Minor: fix ellipsis and string in search placeholder

phosh (0.0.4) purple; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * PhoshLayerShell: Don't realize layer shell's right away.
    This allows us to create them early and keep them around. It also
    makes them behave more like regular Gtk widgets. (Closes: #91)
  * system-prompt: Use a template instead of builder.
    This makes this prompt consistent with all the other layer surfaces we
    have.
  * debian: We can act as polkit auth agent
  * debian: Update description a bit
  * po: Update LINGUAS
  * system-prompt: Wrap on word boundary.
    Otherwise we overflow on small screen sizes
  * system-prompt: Add a border.
    This makes sure we don't have text and buttons pressed to the left and
    right screen edges.
  * lockscreen: Add date (Closes: #101)
  * Update pot file with new strings.
    The date format needs a string to be printed correctly in the
    different locales.
  * lockscreen: Move date, time and icons into a common box.
    This allows spacing.
  * po: Update translations from zanata
  * favorites: Drop labels.
    This makes the "overview issue" go away with up to 8 favorites.
    This improves the status quo until we fixe #89 and merged !187.
  * favorites: Trim down app list.
    These are the ones that the focus is on atm. (Closes: #100)
  * css: Drop HdyArrow css.
    We're currently not using this widget
  * css: Make polkit auth agent's background black too
  * SystemPrompt: Set grid alignment in the ui file
  * system-prompt: Right align labels.
    Following https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/visual-layout.html.en
  * system-prompt: Move checkbox below text inputs
  * system-prompt: Adjust spacing.
    Following https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/visual-layout.html.en
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Right align labels.
    Following https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/visual-layout.html.en
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Adjust spacing.
    Following https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable/visual-layout.html.en
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Use bold font for user name
  * polkit-auth-prompt: Remove empty row
  * PolkitAuthAgent: Remove duplicate gtk_widget_show ()
  * PolkitAuthPrompt: Translate most common request
  * po: Update translatable files
  * po: Update pot file
  * shell: Activate background again
    https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots/issues/897 is true independent if
    there's background surface or not so we're not making matters worse
    by enabling it. (Closes: #76)
  * PhoshPanel: Make signal handlers consistent
  * PhoshLockscreen: include locale.h.
    Fixes build with -O0
  * PoshBackground: Drop things now handled by PhoshLayerSurface
  * PhoshBackground: Use g_autoptr instead of explicit unref
  * PhoshBackground: Get width and height from layer surface
  * PhoshBackground: Drop pointless defaults from init
  * PhoshBackground: Validate signal handler signatures
    while at that move 'self' first like in the rest of the codebase.
  * PhoshBackground: unref settings
  * lockscreen: Set wifi icon visible by default (Closes: #111)
  * PhoshBackground: Drop priv.
    Less code and consistent with other new code.
  * PhoshBackground: Listen to configured signal.
    This is simpler then g_signal_override_class_handler()
  * lockscreen: Deterine wifi status on idle.
    This makes sure we determine the wifi status after the widget set up.
    Otherwise the widget might sometimes stay invisible.
  * PhoshShell: Make background surface span the whole output.
    The background will make sure to not draw over/under panels. (Closes: #6)
  * PhoshBackground: Implement zoom style.
    Listen for picture-option and handle scaled (as already implemented)
    and zoom. If the style is unknown default to zoom like gnome-shell.
    Code taken from GnomeBG.
  * PhoshBackgroundManager: Add manager to handle multiple outputs.
    This handles multiple output making sure we update the backgrounds
    on output changes. (Closes: #113)
  * PhoshBackground: Use g_object_connect
  * PhoshBackground: Use defines for setting keys.
    We need them in several places.
  * PhoshBackground: Don't hardode grey as color.
    This allows to set the background color from gsettings.
  * PhoshFavorites: Scale icon images to 64px
  * favorites: Don't scale by output scale.
    Otherwise icons are way to large.
  * favorites: Use gtk_image_set_pixel_size.
    This leaves the scaling to gtk.
  * PhoshWWanInfo: Set pixel_size when setting widget size
  * PhoshWWanInfo: Don't round trip through pixbuf when using theme icons.
    There's no need to roundtrip through a pixbuf when we're using theme
    icons. This removes blur from the no-sim and sim locked case.
    See: #118
  * favorites: Drop custom drawing
  * service: Restart on compositor crashes.
    So far we wanted to keep the state around for debuggig but it's stable
    enough now that we can restart.
  * layersurface: Use phosh_wayland_get_default() everywhere.
    This makes it consistent with _mapped()
  * Add editorconfig.
    Prompted by tabs in ui files.
  * PolkitAuthPrompt: Make background app paintable.
    This makes it consistent with the gcr system modal dialogs.
  * Use the same style class for gcr and polkit prompts.
    This makes sure they stay visually consistent.
  * PhoshSystemPrompt: Swap ok and cancel.
    Conform to GNOME HIG.
  * PolkitAuthPrompt: Swap ok and cancel.
    Conform to GNOME HIG.
  * app: Add close button.
    Emit a 'app-closed' signal when that button is clicked.
  * Update phosh private protocol to v3
  * PhoshFavorites: Close application on 'app-close' signal (Closes: #67)
  * tests: Use phoc instead of rootston.
    This is our primary compositor and while the usage of the phosh-private
    protocol is optional if we bind to it we require at least version 3
    which is not supported by our rootston fork.
  * PhoshLayerSurface: Destroy layer surface on unmap.
    This and moving some of the initilization from `realized` to `mapped`
    allows us to properly `gtk_widget_{show,hide}()` layer surface widgets.
    This is brought over from squeekboard
    c3a54595ea72638fbc7b65ffc3c26966de772e15
  * PhoshHome: Drop priv.
    This makes the code smaller and esier to read.
  * build: Fix indentation.
    We want two spaces.
  * Use glib-mkenums.
    This will allow us to use enums as types.
  * PhoshLayerSurface: Allow to set size of the layer surface.
    This can be useful to fold/unfold surfaces.
  * PhoshHome: Clarify PHOSH_HOME_HEIGHT.
    Rename to PHOSH_HOME_BUTTON_HEIGHT since to not confuse the home button
    with the home screen (which takes the full screen except for the panel).
  * PhoshHome: Track folded/unfolded state.
    We fold/unfold the surface on home button clicks.
    We use an enum since we might end up with half folded states
    or a different state when using app switch via swipe.
    This surface will later on have the app drawer. (Closes: #89)
  * PhoshHome: Show favorites on home screen.
    Instead of making PhoshFavorites a separate layer surface popup show the
    widget on the home screen by deriving from GtkBox instead of GtkWindow.
  * PhoshActivity: Rename activity-closed signal.
    The name is misleading since the signal is emitted when the close
    button is clicked not when the actual activity is being closed.
    Rename to 'close-clicked' to make that obvious.
  * favorites: Replace assert by g_return_if_fail ()
  * favorites: Use g_return_if_fail in type check.
    This makes sure we don't silently ignore the error.
  * PhoshTopLevelManager: Move function assignments to top.
    This makes it consistent with other classes.
  * PhoshTopLevelManager: Move public methods to the bottom.
    This makes it consistent with other classes.
  * PhoshToplevelManager: Add num-toplevels property.
    This allows us to keep track about opened toplevels.
  * PhoshShell: Unfold home screen when no application is running.
    When we don't have any wayland toplevels show the overview. (Closes: #99)
  * PhoshActivity: Remove unused defaults
  * PhoshAcivities: Drop superfluous braces
  * PhoshActivities: Match property defaults to what's set in `_init()`
  * PhoshActivities: Mark properties as G_PARAM_EXPLICIT_NOTIFY.
    Because they are.
  * PhoshAcitivity: Avoid superfluous object emission and resizes.
    No need to do anything if the propoerty does not change.
  * PhoshLayerSurface: Be verbose when acking configure.
    This is an important event when surface properties change.
  * Add gtk4's list model.
    This is from commit ddc74a08bea170c73effe6eddca45a077bf130a7
  * PhoshHome; Make Image a child of the button.
    This allows for more fine grained styling.
  * PhoshHome: Use CSS animations to change home button arrow direction
  * PhoshHome: Set initial arrow state to 'up'
    Intially the surface is folded. That doesn't matter when starting up
    but it matters when phosh restarts with windows already open.
  * PhoshFavorites: Rename to create_favorite.
    We create a widget but don't add it to the flowbox yet.
  * PhoshFavorites: Use g_auto()
  * PhoshFavorites: Show created favorite.
    This makes sure changing favorites refreshes without restarting phosh.
    This wasn't a problem when favorites was a pop up since the widget
    got recreated when opened.
    Brokey-by: bc2198f6bbe8d3132d711cfa30719578eada5473
  * PhoshFavorites: Avoid gtk_widget_show_all()
    All widgets are being gtk_widget_show()n correctly now.
  * home: Drop superfluous gtk_widget_{show,hide}
  * Settings: Add type checks to callbacks
    while debugging it became obvious that we don't type check
    here which makes life cycle issue fixing harder then necessary.
  * Settings: Swap signal emission and lock trigger.
    The lock trigger brings up new surfaces which discards the popup so the
    object might not exist anymore once we want to emit the signal.

    Broken-by: cb7b20ebf94177199d6a7347d5fe48b144bf81f0
  * Settings: rotation_changed_cb: Move self in front.
    This makes it match the other call backs.
  * LockscreenManager: Only lock session when we go idle.
    So far we locked on any status change which didn't matter since we
    only get the idle information. Now that we get org.gnome.ScreenSaver
    we get other states reported as well.
  * LockScreen: Emit signal when the output should be woken up.
    This is useful to indicate that  the output used by the lock screen
    should be woken up e.g.  on keypress.
  * LockScreenManager: Remember activation time.
    Save the point in time the lock screen gets activated, this will
    be used by the screen saver manager.
  * LockscreenManager: Emit signal when all screens should be woken up.
    This is mostly meant for org.gnome.ScreenSaver
  * Add PhoshScreenSaverManager.
    This adds the skeletion for the org.gnome.ScreenSaver
    DBus API that allows applications get the lock state
    and ask for screen lock.
  * ScreensaverManager: Hook up to LockscreenManager.
    Implement org.gnome.ScreenSaver by invoking the appropriate methods
    on our Lockscreenmanager and listen to it's releveant signals.
    We keep this in a separte object to keep the lock screen code
    separte from the DBus interaction.
    We inject the lock screen manager instead of fetching the singleton
    to make the code more self contained.
  * helpers: Add script to check screen saver state
  * Lockshield: Use type as parent, not class
  * LockShield: Drop unneeded custom rendering.
    We don't need a drawing area and no custom rendering when we just
    want to render a black background.
  * tests: Test AppGridButton
  * AppGridButton: Remove superfluous initializers
  * AppGridButton: Rename pspec to props.
    Just cosmetics to make it consistent with the other classes.
  * AppGridButton: Whitespace cleanups
  * AppGridButton: Use getters and setters for GAppInfo.
    This makes the property hander sway smaller
  * PhoshAppInfo: Add tests for new methods and constructor
  * gitlab-ci: Add coverage information
  * README: coverage badge.
    This is a bit misleading since it only covers unit test coverage and
    even that dosn't run all the tests.
  * tests: Add app-list-model tests
  * tools/app-scroll: Fix activity scaling.
    Otherwise activities are just as large as the close button.
  * tools/app-scroll: Drop max-* properties.
    They were dropped from app-grid-button as well.
    Spotted-by: Zander Brown
  * Overview: Rename overview evbox and flowbox to apps.
    This contains the application (favorites and later on installed
    applications).
  * lockscreen: Slide lockscreen down on timeout.
    This makes the lock screen slide down instead of coming back up after
    timeout. (Closes: #105)
  * layer-surface: Allow to set keyboard interactivity
  * home: Move fold/unfold logic into a single if/else
  * home: Allow keyboard input when unfolded.
    This allows application search to receive keyboard input and will
    e.g. allow keyboard based window switching later on.
  * defaults: Drop terminal from favorites.
    With the app drawer it's easily accessible and we're back
    to one line of favorites which looks way better.
  * Update translations from zanata
  * build: bump version.
    We released 0.0.3 a while ago
  * Add PhoshNotifyManager.
    This will handle the org.freedestkop.Notifications DBus protocol
  * phosh-notification: Add notification widget.
    This is a layer surface that handles displaying a single notification.
    When adding notifications to the lock screen, etc. we will likel make
    this a data only type that is consumed by the various implementations
    but that depends on how the designs for this will look like.
  * notify-manager: Create basic notifications.
    Activities, animating slide in/out, showing notification on the lock
    screen, do not disturb mode and silencing individual application are
    left as follow-ups.
  * debian: Provide notification-daemon.
    We provide the DBus daemon and basic functionality
  * Bump libhandy requirement.
    The arrows need 0.0.11
  * notifications: Don't leak app_icon
  * Release phosh 0.0.4

  [ Tobias Bernard ]
  * Top panel: move clock down a tiny bit
  * Lockscreen: improve spacing on clock, date, icons
  * Minor: lockscreen.ui indentation
  * Lockscreen: Stop arrow animation after 15 cycles.
    This should mitigate #108 somewhat.
  * Settings: make circular button styling specific to settings
  * Favorites: remove button styling and circular shape, add icon shadow.
    This also makes 4 icons fit into onto the screen at 360px.
  * Favorites: highlight on click, instead of hover
  * App switcher: No margin and border radius on the title overlay
  * Fake app placeholder: round top corners
  * App Switcher: styling for temporary close button

  [ Dorota Czaplejewicz ]
  * session: Use the default OSK instead of Virtboard

  [ Sebastian Krzyszkowiak ]
  * PolkitAuthAgent: fix build with Polkit >= 0.114.
    Polkit 0.114 introduced bunch of predefined g_autoptr cleanups, which
    leads to compilation failure due to duplicate cleanup definition for
    PolkitSubject. Note that even the latest polkit doesn't have a cleanup
    for PolkitAgentListener defined, so it's left there unguarded.
  * PhoshBackground: Draw the wallpaper at full resolution on HiDPI screens
  * background: Unescape the URI of the background file.
    Fixes #130
  * Use wlr-foreign-toplevel-management instead of private protocol.
    Introduces PhoshToplevelManager and PhoshToplevel classes for
    managing and representing toplevel surfaces.
    Thanks to that:
     - it doesn't match the window to close via its title or app id,
       always trying to close the correct window instead
     - it removes the window from the overview only after it really got
       closed - which is especially noticable in case of windows that
       refuse to be closed
     - it updates the list automatically as the changes happen, without
       having to close and open the overview back again
    Closes #37
  * PhoshApp: Rename to PhoshActivity.
    Single application can be represented by multiple PhoshApps. It's also
    not a window, as in the future, multiple windows may be represented
    as a single PhoshApp as well - therefore, PhoshActivity seems to be
    the most fitting name to this entity.
  * PhoshHome: Hide the keyboard button when unfolded
  * PhoshHome: Don't set the width of the home bar.
    When setting 0 as width value, the compositor will set the width
    automatically according to anchors.
    This fixes an issue of folded home bar size not being updated after screen
    rotation until it's unfolded.
  * PhoshLayerSurface: Allow to set anchor margins of the surface
  * PhoshLayerSurface: Allow to change the exclusive zone value
  * PhoshHome: (Un)folding animation.
    Uses layer-surface margins to animate the unfolding without resizing
    the surface.
  * PhoshHome: Adjust arrow transition duration to match unfolding time
  * PhoshHome: Show correct arrow orientation with GTK animations disabled
  * shell: Fold home screen when a new toplevel appears.
    Closes #154
  * home: Fold on Escape key press.
    This doesn't matter much for phone, but makes the interaction much
    more pleasant on desktop.
  * overview: Hide the list of activities when there are none.
    This allows the app launcher to take all available space.
  * phosh-wayland: Don't require wlr-foreign-toplevel-manager extension.
    It's not very widely implemented yet and it's considered a privileged
    protocol that's unlikely to be exposed by default anyway.
    Closes #144
  * layersurface: Add phosh_layer_surface_wl_surface_commit function
  * home: Remove gtk_widget_queue_draw from (un)folding animation.
    This was causing a massive performance drop on the devkit, while a surface
    commit is all that's really needed there.
  * home: Reset the app grid state when unfolding.
    This includes clearing the search field and scrolling the list to the top.
  * shell: Fold the home screen when unfolding settings screen
  * shell: Hide the keyboard when unfolding the home screen
  * app-grid: Use g_auto cleanup macros
  * app-grid: Store the list of favorites.
    This will allow to skip allocate/free cycle per every entry when filtering.
  * app-grid: Don't show favorites on the app list.
    Fixes #164

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * build: use the kwarg for PIE
  * switcher: Rework app switcher.
    This moves the window title and application icons to the bottom of the
    running application widget and uses a fake window where the actual app
    conent will go later on.
  * build: handy as a subproject.
    Some of us don't want to install handy master globally
  * general: ignore VSCode settings/metadata
  * build: split some components into static lib
    makes tests/demos simpler
  * tools: app-scroll demo.
    Simple demo of PhoshApp
  * tests: use the full name not just the first letter.
    Meson being too clever for it's own good
  * favorites: Switch to kgx (Closes: #133)
  * gtk-list-model: Adjust to build out of gtk4's tree
  * Add PhoshAppGridButton.
    This will be used in the app drawer for launchers
  * Favorites: Use PhoshAppGridButton.
    This will be used in the app drawer for all launchers but for now it's
    just favourites
  * launcher: force wrapping of long titles
  * app-grid-button: handle NULL app-info
  * launcher: import app-list-model.
    Taken from my maynard fork
  * overview: rename PhoshFavorites now it's funcation has changed.
    The overview is the widget that contains the
     - activities (running applications)
     - the favorites
     - the app drawer
  * app-grid: AppGrid widget to launch installed applications
  * overview: Add app-grid
  * tools: Add wrapper to run standalone tools.
    Similar to phosh's run to set e.g. the schema dir
  * tools: Add tool to show app-grid outside the shell.
    Provider wrapper to setup env to run tools
  * overview: Move favorites launchers into app-grid.
    They inetract closely, e.g. on search so it makes sense to have them in
    the same widget.
    TODO: the css name change from phosh-favorites to phosh-overview should
    go in a separte commit (Closes: #38)

  [ Adrien Plazas ]
  * system-prompt: Style overhaul.
    This makes system prompts look more like part of the shell than part of
    apps.

  [ Sybolt de Boer ]
  * Use g_value_set_int() to set an int

  [ Heather Ellsworth ]
  * Add Contacts to list of favorites

  [ Alexander Mikhaylenko ]
  * favorites: Resize apps before size allocation.
    Instead of connecting to 'size-allocate' signal on evbox_running_apps,
    override size_allocate vfunc on the window itself, then do the resizing
    before chaining up.
    This will allow to avoid glitches with paginator.
  * activity: Simplify sizing.
    Follow window aspect ratio without minimum width and height. Switch to
    width-for-height geometry management.
    When favorites widget is allocated, set window width and height from
    favorites's own allocation before chaining up, this avoids any glitches
    on the first allocation.
    Remove now unused max-width and max-height properties.
  * Introduce PhoshArrow.
    An animated arrow. This will be used for home/overview transition.
  * home: Use PhoshArrow for animation
  * home: Use libhandy animation functions.
    See https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/libhandy/merge_requests/308
  * meson: Bump libhandy version to 0.0.11
  * lockscreen: Fix indentation in xml
  * lockscreen: Hide dialer action buttons in xml.
    There's no point in doing this only on swipe up.
  * lockscreen: Follow finger when swiping.
    Pack the two pages into a PhoshPaginator. This also allows to swipe back
    from keypad to the info screen.
    Remove the GtkEventBox around the info page, as the paginator is already
    a subclass of GtkEventBox.

phosh (0.0.3) purple; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * IdleManager: Use G_GUINT64_FORMAT.
    We missed that one. This breaks the build on armhf.
  * Monitor: Save transform too
  * Monitor: Allow to detect flipped outputs
  * Monitor: Allow to get rotation by degrees
  * Shell: Determine usable area by output transform.
    Instead of looking at our rotation property look at the monitors actual
    transform instead. (Closes: #55)
  * MonitorMnager: Report transform too
  * MonitorManager: Fix formatting
  * Shell: Fix type of 'rotation' property
  * Shell: Derive rotation property from primary monitor's rotation.
    This way they can never get out of sync.
  * Shell: Setup a primary monitor after probing outputs.
    This way we don't have to make any assumptions. We don't do this via
    set_primary_monitor since we don't want to trigger panel recreation to
    avoid flickering.
  * Settings: Switch shutdown and lockscreen.
    This matche gnome-shell's layout.
  * Settings: Make sure the buttons stay circular
  * MonitorManager: Specify integer types in g_variant_builder_add.
    This makes sure we treat guint64 correctly.
  * App: Don't print title if it's identical to the appplications name.
    This avoids printing the same thing twice.
  * rooston.ini: Drop scale=2.
    We had this for the testing the OLED displays. The devkit has a separte
    HDMI to attach large screens.
  * gitignore tag files
  * Fix URLs and copyright holder.
    We moved repos a while ago
  * rootston.ini: Scale rootston on DSI-1 output.
    The devkit's LCD panel is DSI-1 and we want scaled output there.
  * session: Remove incorrect error parameter in DBus call
  * run: Allow to skip gnome-session.
    It's not always needed and floods the CI logs
  * ci: Skip gnome-session for valgrind run.
    This makes the logs better readable and we don't need it there.
  * meson: Print phosh version as well
  * run: Use glib's valgrind suppressions as well
  * settings: Add separate meson file.
    It's better to track sources per directory.
  * Settings: Simplify rotate evaluation
  * Add gvc submodule.
    This submodule will be used for volume control. It's also used
    by gnome-shell and g-c-c.
  * Wire up output volume control.
    Based on gvc-channel-bar from gnome-control-center. We'll split this out
    of settings.c once we handle more volume controls.
  * ci: Drop valgrind run until we have more RAM.
    It seems the build node drops out atm
  * settings: Make settings use the full screen width.
    Wrap it in a HdyColumn for that to not look totally out of place
    on large screens.
  * Remove some unused components from the session.
    This brings down the number of X11 dependencies and drops things that
    crash frequently (although unused). We can add these back later once
    needed and when the necessary wayland protocols are in place.
  * Favorites: Use a GtkBox instead of a GtkFloxBox for running apps.
    This allows to scroll vertically
  * rootston.ini: Map seat to DSI-1 instead of HDMI.
    This makes rotation work and it's far more likely to be used on the LCD
    atm. This needs a proper fix in the compositor to be better at input
    mapping (https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/wlroots/issues/23).
  * gitlab-ci: Build debs too
  * shell: Prefer dark theme.
    See: https://source.puri.sm/Librem5/librem5-base/issues/6
  * PhoshWayland: Add and use phosh_wayland_roundtrip.
    Based on a patch by Simon Ser.
  * PhoshLockscreenManager: Add missing chain up in constructed()
  * PhoshLockscreenManager: Drop unused parent
  * PhoshWwanInfo: Fix callback signature.
    We don't use the other params but it's better to have this correct.
  * PhoshWwanInfo: Simplify signal handler disconnects
  * PhoshPanel: Fix element order.
    This makes glade happy so we get no diff when saving.
  * top-panel.ui: Fix indentation
  * PhoshShell: Delay gui setup.
    If we do it in an idle callback we're sure the shell object is already
    there so we have all the managers at our disposal to e.g. connect
    widgets to them.
  * PhoshShell: Make custom widget types known.
    This makes sure we can use them in UI files independent from any loading
    order.
  * Add PhoshWifiManager.
    This keeps track of the wifi devices by interfacing with NetworkManager
    and gets the current signal ruality. We delay it's creation until it's
    needed.
    We can later on add support for ad-hoc networks.
  * Add PhoshWifiInfo widget.
    This connects to the wifi manager to display the current wifi state.
    Using it in the panel is then just a matter of adding it to the ui file.
  * PhoshLockScreen: Display wifi status.
    Hook the wifi status into the lockscreen too
    Use the WifiInfo widget here too. (Closes: #10)
  * d/control: Build-dep on at-spi2-core.
    On the devkit we don't pull in recommends but GTK+ wants it to run the
    tests in a meaningfull way.
  * Add HACKING to clarify coding style and other matters
  * README: Add pipeline status
  * README: Make sure build-deps are up to date.
    Use the tested list from d/control instead of hardcoding it.
  * PhoshMonitor: Emit signal when monitor is fully configured.
    Emit a signal when we received all of the configuration data from
    the compositor.
  * PhoshMonitor: Update comment
  * PhoshMonitorManager: Fix function declartion.
    Use a better variable name.
  * PhoshWayland: Maintain outputs in hash table.
    This duplicates the static wl_ouput GPtrArray which will be removed
    at the end of this series.
  * PhoshWayland: listen for outputs going away
  * PhoshWayland: Add functions to query outputs
  * PhoshMonitorManager: Pick up changed wl_outputs
    and signal when we added/removed a monitor. (Closes: #46)
  * Move initial handling from PhoshShell to PhoshMonitorManager.
    This move wl_output processing into the one place that has a way better
    idea what to do.
  * PhoshWayland: Kill the GPtrArray in favour of the GHashTable
  * LockScreenManager: Listen for monitor changes (Closes: #51)
  * PhoshLockscreenManager: simplify signal disconnects
  * Use #pragma in all headers
  * Add PhoshOskManager.
    Class to handle OSK interaction.
  * PhoshShell: Add PhoshOskManager
  * PhoshOskButton: Use PhoshOskManager.
    Don't dupliate code that is in PhoshOskManager and keep the DBus
    interaction in one place.
  * PhoshOskButton: Drop private data
  * PhoshShell: Add getter for lockscreen manager
  * PhoshOskManager: Hide keyboard on screen lock (Closes: #75)
  * PhoshShell: Close OSK when displaying favorites or settings (Closes: #81)
  * README: Prefer wlroot's X11 backend when nested.
    This one gets the window size right.
  * rooston.ini: Use the phone's resolution with the X11 backend
  * PhoshLockScreen: Only show clock on the lock screen.
    We don't want date or weekday there. (Closes: #85)
  * helpers: Make it simple to use glade with PhoshLayerShells.
    Temporarily replace the PhoshLayerShell by a GtkWindow known to glade.
    We could extend the glade-catalog but this way doesn't require any
    special setup.
  * rootston.ini: Don't scale X11 display.
    This helps people with screens that don't have 1440 vertical pixels.
  * phosh.in: Prefer phoc over rootston
  * PhoshLayerSurface: Don't use gtk_widget_show_all()
    gtk_widget_show ought to be enough. Widgets need to setup themselfes
    properly.
  * Become a policy kit authentiation agent.
    Somewhat based on gnome-shell's implementation. (Closes: #22)
  * debian: Add dependency so we can be a polkit auth agent
  * pot: Update translatable strings
  * Update translations from zanata
  * rootston.ini: Fix horizontal resolution.
    We have 360 not only 320 pixels.
    Thanks to Zander Brown
  * Lockshield: Use black background too
  * Lockscreen: Make arrows a bit thinner
  * Home: Make center button expand again.
    This unbreaks clicking the home bar. Otherwise only the image
    itself would be sensitive.
  * css: Add unit to font size.
    Silences a gtk warning.
  * PhoshWWanInfo: Drop priv.
    We're not going to derive from it and this makes the code simpler.
  * PhoshWWanInfo: Allow to set icon size
  * rooston.ini: Set window size for wayland as well
  * README: Fix some wording
  * README: Don't special case running nested on x11
    wayland works too.

  [ Dorota Czaplejewicz ]
  * build: Use the right path to the source.
    Tests wouldn't build if the build directory was outside of the source
    tree.
  * build: Remove duplicated gio dependency

  [ emersion ]
  * Update the wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1 protocol
  * PhoshWayland: Add wlr_output_manager v1 protocol.
    We don't make the lack of that protocol fatal atm since the rootston
    currently on the devkit doesn't have that code yet.

  [ Zander Brown ]
  * Make top and home-bar black.

  [ Tobias Bernard ]
  * Top panel: equal spacing on icons on left and right
  * Top panel: make time bold
  * Settings menu: Black background, simplified styling
  * Lock screen: black background, margin fixes, thinner clock font
  * Minor: Change "PIN" to "Passcode"
  * Home bar: use custom, wider swipe arrow icon
  * Home bar: move keyboard button to the right
  * Home bar: rounded, smaller OSK button
  * Lockscreen: replace HdyArrows with a an image + CSS animation
  * Settings menu: add button outlines, improve spacing
  * Minor: better top bar clock style class name
  * Top bar: make status icons 16px

phosh (0.0.2) purple; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Günther ]
  * Update translations from zanata
  * home: Add keyboard button.
    Add a keyboard button to the home buttons bar. This will allow to unfold
    the OSK.
  * monitor-manager: Use output names.
    This allows us to give the monitors more meaningful names instead of
    made up numbers and to correctly identify built in displays.
  * shell: Move panels on primary monitor change.
    When a new primary monitor is set move the panels around.
    This also fixes the home panel not being disposed.
  * system-prompter: Pass on the wl_output and not the monitor to new
    prompters.  This makes sure they always end up on the primary monitor.
  * Add basic org.gnome.Mutter.Idle DBus protocol support.
    This allows e.g. g-s-d power to track our idle time for e.g. dimming the
    display.
  * LockscreenManager: Rely on gnome-session for idle detection.
    This makes us properly respect idle inhibitors e.g. when watching movies.
  * Favorites: Drop weston terminal.
    Don't hardcode weston terminal anymore since gnome-terminal now also on
    the dev boards.
  * Settings menu: Add shutdown button

  [ David Boddie ]
  * Updated Debian package dependencies and .ini file location.
