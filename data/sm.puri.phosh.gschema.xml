      <summary>Which backend to use for interfacing with the cellular modem</summary>
      <description>
        The available backends are 'modemmanager' for ModemManager (the default)
        and 'ofono' for oFono. This setting is only read when Phosh starts, so a
        shell restart is required after changing it.
